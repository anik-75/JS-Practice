    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const copy = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    copy.push("John");

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("players", players);
    console.log("copy", copy);
    // now here is the problem!
    copy[1] = "John";
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy2 = [].concat(players);
    const copy3 = [...players];
    const copy4 = Array.from(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "Wes Bos",
      age: 80,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const obj = Object.assign({}, person);
    const obj2 = { ...person };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
